### üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing solar energy production in the USA through intelligent classification using AI. By integrating **solar panel system data** (voltage, current, power) with **key environmental weather parameters** (humidity, cloud cover, visibility, and solar radiation), the goal is to predict solar power efficiency and enable smart energy management systems for better decision-making in grid operations and storage.

### üìÅ Datasets Used

1. **Solar Dataset (`df_1`)**
   - Columns: `date`, `voltage`, `current`, `power`
   - Time-series solar generation data from solar panels.

2. **Weather Dataset (`df_2`)**
   - Columns: `datetime`, `humidity`, `cloudcover`, `visibility`, `solarradiation`
   - Time-series environmental conditions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**
  - Time-based plots, correlation matrices, interactive visualizations (Plotly).
  - Analysis of weather features vs solar power output.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Parsing datetime formats, merging solar and weather datasets.
  - Creating a classification label based on power threshold.
  - Normalization, handling missing values, and addressing class imbalance with SMOTE.

- **Modeling: Classification Models**
  - Three machine learning classifiers were used:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - XGBoost Classifier

- **Evaluation & Comparison**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix and performance comparison using histograms.

### üíº Business Impact

‚úÖ **Smart Grid Decision Making**  
The classification model enables predictive insights into when solar output is likely to be high or low, allowing smart grids to dynamically adjust loads and reduce dependence on non-renewable sources.

‚úÖ **Efficient Battery Storage Usage**  
Predicting low-output periods in advance allows for optimized charging and discharging of energy storage units, improving energy availability and reducing waste.

‚úÖ **Predictive Maintenance**  
Identifying mismatches between weather-predicted and actual solar outputs can indicate potential issues in the system, triggering maintenance alerts before critical failures occur.

‚úÖ **Cost Reduction & Operational Efficiency**  
With accurate predictions, utility companies and solar farm operators can make better decisions, reducing downtime, enhancing profitability, and delivering consistent energy.

‚úÖ **Sustainability & Green Energy Goals**  
Maximizing solar output through data-driven approaches accelerates the transition to sustainable energy and supports national and global climate goals.
